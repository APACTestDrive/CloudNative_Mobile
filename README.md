# ORACLE Cloud Test Drive #

## Introduction ##

This Oracle Cloud project contains the lab materials for the Oracle Cloud Test Drive events for Cloud Native Apps and Mobile organized in various locations.  Participants can experiment through these labs with a series of Oracle Cloud Services like JCS, DevCS, ACCS, ICS and MCS. Thorough this Cloud Native and Mobile Test Drive, participants will have chances to know how they can use Oracle Cloud Services to implement Cloud Native Apps, Microservices, Integrations and Mobile Services.  

More specifically, following topics are currently included in this project:

## Cloud Native Apps Lab ##
This lab is composed of :
+ Backgrounds on Cloud Native Apps - What is Cloud Native Apps?, Why you need Cloud Native Apps?, etc.
+ Prepare environment for Cloud Native Apps - Set up the infrastructure to run your applications : Create a JCS Weblogic instance and DBMS (Oracle DBCS)
+ Cloud Native Apps Development - Building applications with DevOps: using Developer Cloud Service to build a J2EE application and deploying to JCS.

## Microservices ##
This lab shows you how to prepare an environment for Microserivces and develop Mircoserivces using Oracle ACCS (Application Container Cloud Serivces). This lab is composed of : 
+ Backgrounds on Microservices - What is Microservices?, Why you need Cloud Native Apps?, Examples of Microserivces, etc.
+ Prepare environment for Microservices - Set up the infrastructure to run your Microserves : Create an ACCSc instance
+ Develop Microservices - Building Microservices.

## Integrations ##
This lab shows you how to prepare an environment for Microserivces and develop Mircoserivces using Oracle ACCS (Application Container Cloud Serivces).

## Mobile Cloud Services ##
This chapter will help you understand the use of MCS, the Mobile Cloud Service.  As an result, you will develop a simple mobile application and install it on your Mobile phone.

The tutorial for this lab is located on [Oracle.com](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E65774_01/tutorials/tut_mcs_max_short/tut_mcs_max_short_1.html)

## Integration Cloud Service and Process Cloud Service ##
These labs are not yet available through Github.  If you are participating in a CTD, you will receive the relevant Word documents with the tutorials.
