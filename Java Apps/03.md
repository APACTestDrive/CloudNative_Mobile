## Using Eclipse IDE (Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse) with Oracle Developer Cloud Service ##

### Introduction ###
You can access Oracle Developer Cloud Service projects from Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse (OEPE), Oracle JDeveloper, and NetBeans IDE. The Eclipse IDE and the Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse (OEPE) includes integration for Oracle Developer Cloud Service, which conveniently exposes the most common Cloud development tasks from within the IDE.

Oracle Developer Cloud Service integration with the Eclipse IDE includes the following:

+ A dedicated Oracle Cloud view that displays Oracle Developer Cloud Service projects of which you are a member
+ Integration with Oracle Developer Cloud Service and the Mylyn Issues system
+ Source control system integration with the Oracle Developer Cloud Service Git repository

Instructor should have provided you VirtualBox Installer and the Virtual Machine image which consists of Linux and Eclipse IDE pre-installed.
You can download the Eclipse IDE from [http://www.eclipse.org/](http://www.eclipse.org/) and OEPE from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/eclipse/downloads/index.html).

If you are using the Eclipse IDE, download and install the Oracle Cloud Tools plugin from the Eclipse IDE marketplace. In OEPE, the plugin is installed by default.

11. Browse the location of the cloned repository in `/home/oracle/workspace/` folder and select `acc/springboot-sample` subfolder. If the workspace location is the default it should look like similar to the following: `/home/oracle/workspace/springboot.git-9534/springboot-sample`
Please note, that you need to give one of the subfolder of the local repository.
Click Finish.

#### Change code and test using continuous integration ####

The project hosted on Oracle Developer Cloud Service has build job which ensures that new application build and deployment to Application Container Cloud Service happens when any developer push code changes to Git repository.

Check the process modifying small piece on the application. First check the default page of the application. Open the tree view myOracleCloud -> Applications -> springboot-demo. Right click on springboot-demo and select Open In Browser menu item.
![](images/03/14.png)

New browser is opened and you should see the application's home page.
![](images/03/15.png)

Go back to OEPE and in the Project Explorer area find the *springbootdemo* project and open the **Deployed Resources -> webapp -> WEB-INF -> views -> welcome.jsp**
![](images/03/16.png)

Modify the following part:

  	<br>SpringBoot application demo. Current server time: <%= new java.util.Date() %> <br>

To what you would like to see on the page. For example:

	<br>SpringBoot application demo. <font color="red">MODIFIED IN OEPE.</font> Current server time: <%= new java.util.Date() %> <br>  	

Save the changes. To commit and push changes to Git right click on project and select Team -> Commit...
![](images/03/17.png) 

Git Staging view is displayed. First make sure the `welcome.jsp` is in the *Staged Changes* area. Type a commit message e.g. 'Home page modified in OEPE'. Optionally enter your name or cloud username and give a (valid or fake) email address in the following format as the screenshot shows. Click **Commit and Push...**
![](images/03/18.png)

In the Push dialog leave the default branch and click OK.

Now change back to the browser and check the Build page in the Oracle Developer Cloud Service project. You should see that a new build (in our case: *springboot_build*) has been fired by the Git changes.
![](images/03/20.png)

Once the job is done change to the tab to Deploy and you can see that a new deployment has been started too. If you remember the Deployment was configured to redeploy every time when a new successful build artifact is ready.
![](images/03/21.png)

Now check the changes of the home page of the application. Open the tree view myOracleCloud -> Applications -> springboot-demo. Right click on springboot-demo and select Open In Browser menu item.
![](images/03/14.png)

New browser (tab) is opened and you should see the changes (red text) on the application's home page.

Now that we have the source code in our Developer Cloud Service managed Git Repository, we need to create a build process that will be triggered whenever a commit is made to the master branch. We will setup a **shell script** build process in this section.

### Create Default Build Process

- Click **Build** on the navigation panel to access the build page and click **[+ New Job]**

- In the New Job popup window, enter `QR Code Generator Build` for Job Name and click **Save**.

- You are now placed into the job configuration screen.

- Click the **Source Control** tab. Select **Git** radio button. In the Repositories section, select **QRCodeMicroservice.git** from the URL drop down.

	**Note:** Make sure you select the Git repository for the QR Code Microservice.

- Click **Triggers** tab. Check **Based on SCM polling schedule**.

- Click the **Build Steps** tab, click **Add Build Step** and select **Execute shell**.

- In the Command textarea, enter: `npm install`

- Click the **Post Build** tab. Check **Archive the artifacts**. For File to Archive, enter `**/target/*` and verify **GZIP** is chosen as the Compression Type.

- Click **Save** to complete the configuration. A build should start automatically within 1-2 minutes. If it dows not start automatically, click on the **[ Build Now ]** button. The status will change to something similar to the following diagram.

- The build will take serval minutes to complete. Wait for the build to complete before continue to the next step - ** as we need the build artifact to create the deployment configuration**.

### Create Default Deployment Process

- Click **Deploy** to access the Deployments page and click the **[+ New Configuration]** button.

- Enter the following data:

	**Configuration Name:** QRCodeGeneratorDeploy

	**Application Name:** qrcodegenerator

- **As you have created the deployment in the Offer REST API
Microservice, you can REUSE the same target**.

  In the **Deployment Target**, choose the **SAME** one you created above. It should be something similar to `Application Container Cloud` **em2 / your-identity-domain / your-user-name**

- A window **Deploy to Application Container Cloud** will popup, confirm the information and **ENTER the password**, then click **[Test Connection]** button.   

	**Data Center:** `your datacenter, e.g. em2, em3, etc`

	**Identity Domain:** `your identity domain, e.g. gse00012345, etc`

	**Username:** `username to login to MyService, e.g. cloud.admin, etc`

	**Password:** `password of the cloud user`

- In the ACCS Properties, set

	**Runtime** to `Node`

 	**Subscription** to `Hourly`

- Set **Type** to `Automatic` and **CHECK** Deploy stable build only

- Select from the **Job**, this name should match the build job above, e.g. `QR Code Generator Build`

- Select from the **Artifact**, this name should match the archive artifact above and the package.json of your source code, e.g. `target/qrcodegenerator.zip`  

- After fill in the above information, click **Save** button.

- In your deployment job, click the gear drop down and select **Start**

- The deployment job will be put into a queue for process. Wait until the message **Starting application** changes to **Last deployment successded**. Ask for help from your instructor if the deployment fails.

### Login to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service

- Navigate back to the Oracle Public Cloud tab. Click **Dashboard** to return back to main Cloud Service Dashboard.

- On the Application Container Cloud Service (ACCS) click the humburger button and select **Open Service Console**

- On the ACCS Service Console you can view all the deployed applications including our newly create **JETFrontEndApp**.

- Click on URL or copy and paste the URL into the address bar of a new tab to bring up the application.

  Be reminded that you will need the REST endpoint and the **offer id** in order to generate a QR code.

  Finally, you can access to the following deployed application URL to verify build and deployment:
		https://{Your-JCS-WLS-Address}/loyalty/jsp/welcome.jsp
