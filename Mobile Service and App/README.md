## Introduction ##
The global market has experienced a tremendous increase in the number of smartphone users.The number of smartphone subscriptions worldwide (6.8 billion) is now almost equal to the number of people on the planet (seven billion). The increasing number of smartphone users in the global market has led to a tremendous increase in the number of apps that consumers use on their phones. In fact, we have huge reliance on mobile services for our daily life. Due to this trend, enterprises are eager to build more and more mobile services for better customer experiences, operational excellences and higher business values in their businesses. Therefore, we can say that Mobile is the key of Digital Transofmration. In other words, enterprises may suffer distruption by competition.
And mobile application development in businesses is much more of a reality – Let's see what are the challenges of mobile application development in terms of business and technical view.

## Business Challenges in Mobile ##
To be more competitive, many enterprises are introducing more and more mobile applications. By the way, there are some of major challenges enterprises are suffering. As you can see in the below picture, Gartner predicts half the apps deployed today will be replaced or rewritten by next year. Overall, more than half are never downloaded. And even if downloaded, 25% are deleted after one use!
It’s not easy to have successful mobile applications. Which is why we need to build better apps faster in order to keep pace with mobile demands.

## Technical Challegnes in Mobile ##
As well as Business Challenges, enterprises have some of difficulties in developing mobile applications. To develop mobile applications, we need to have the expertise in:
+ Developing to and supporting multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, etc.)
+ Prepare environments for dev, test and production
+ How to monitor an analyze mobile services
+ Security and identity protocols and policies to different backends
+ Integration with a variety of backends
+ What tools do you use to build them?

How do you make it all work and play nicely together? It should be clear that building the UI becomes the easy part. The hard part is integration and managing all these other components. Through this mobile lab, we will have a chance to how Oracle MCS (Mobile Cloud Service) can help overcome business and technical challenges in mobile development.

## Oracle Mobile Solution Strategy ##
To make things easy, Oracle encourages developers to use any of the popular tools available – whether it’s native development with iOS and Android, to 3rd party and open frameworks like Ionic, Angular, Sencha, and Xamarin. We call it "Mobile Client Agnostic". 
We also incorporate Mobile services that offer data sync, storage, location services, messaging. Access to local services, like camera, contacts, GPS, etc. In the below section, you can see them in detail. And API integration with Node.js, shaping connected RESTful or SOAP interfaces into mobile friendly accessible RESTful APIs. There’s also a trend towards low code, no code development -  Oracle also supports this trendy tool called MAX (Mobile Application Accelerator) as part of MCS.

To demonstrate Oracle's capabilities in mobile development, we will give you below labs to get an understanding of how you can develop mobile applications - better and faster.
+ Set up Push Notification and Send Notification to mobile app
+ Develop Custom APIs and Custom Code to interact external serivces
+ Create Custom Analytics Report to track “Offer Completion by User”

At the end of this lab, we will go through End to End demo on Loyalty Management based on all the labs we’ve done.
