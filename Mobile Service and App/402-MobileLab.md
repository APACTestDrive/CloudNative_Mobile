## 402: Develop Custom APIs and Custom Code to extend mobile services ##

### Introduction ###
![](../common/images/mobile/mcsgs_dt_003_customapi.png)

You can create custom REST APIs to build up a library of services that can be used by your mobile applications. Custom APIs are particularly useful for aggregating data from other sources, adding any relevant business logic, and returning results in a mobile-friendly way for mobile applications.

### About the Exercise Today ###
In this exercise, we will:
- Create custom APIs and define its endpoints for loyalty management. (TBD: Need to provide sample data for APIs with link in the common/assets/mobile folder)
- Associate the APIs with the loyalty management MBE.
- Test the endpoints with mock data. (TBD: Need to provide sample data for APIs with link in the common/assets/mobile folder)
- Implement the API for loyalty management. (We will provide the code for this here --> put link TBD: Need to provide sample data for APIs with link in the common/assets/mobile folder.)
- Test the implementation

### Prerequisites ###
- Loyalty management MBE created in the previous lab.
- Mock data and custom code.

#### Create custom APIs and define its endpoints for loyalty management ####
To be Described.
In this lab, you will create a custom API for loayalty managment. In fact, we need 3 custome APIs like ~~~ for the loyalty management. Creating customer APIs are the same job. So, here you will experience developing one customer API called "--". All other custom APIs are ready and provided for your use in this lab.
